###Namespace
allows you to enter a specific context of a code package or module to remove ambiguity/ having multiple namespace's with the same methods.

this is how it is done in xhtml
```xml
    xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
    <h:form></h:form>
```
### EL (Expression langauge)
used to reference object properties in the back end 

```xml
#{profileController.theModel.clientName}
```
